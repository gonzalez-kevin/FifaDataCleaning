# Fifa_Data_Cleaning
Applying changes to the Fifa player stats dataset to make the data more usable for further analysis

**Here are the questions I was interested in asking:**
1. Is this dataset viable for further analysis?
2. What can be modified in the dataset to make variables more clear to users?

**I took the following steps to complete my analysis:**
1. Performed general EDA to get a better understanding of the dataset
2. Standardized various columns due to inconsistent formatting for observations in the data
3. Renamed columns in order to make variables easier to understand for users
4. Added additional columns referencing dates in the original dataset to make further analysis on the dataset simpler

**Here are my key takeaways:**
1. The original dataset had variables with inconsistent formatting which needed to be standardized
2. The original dataset was not optimized for further analysis. Adding fields extracted from date fields will make the resulting dataset more usable
3. Converting some string type fields to type integer allows for further analysis of the resulting dataset
